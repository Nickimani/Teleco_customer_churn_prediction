## Aim of the project

Create a machine learning model that can predict if a customer will leave the company or not.

## Business Understanding

Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA are keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months.
They have provided a bunch of past data about when customers have left before. The data also includes info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other information pertaining to them.

## Problem Statement

For a teleco business, customers mean the world for success. Therefore, retaining customers is key in facilitating the success of the business. I am looking to give insight on customers, ways in which to retain them and/or prepare the company on who's going to live. This will be able to advise the company of the way forward.

## Final Model

The model selected is a decision tree classifier with an accuracy score of ~77%

## Conclusions

The final model's perfomance is way better than random guessing or simply assuming that all or no customers will leave. However, it is not good enough for deployment yet.
